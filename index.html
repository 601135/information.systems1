                <h3 id="heading1">Data Visualization</h3>

                <p>Data visualization is like turning raw data into a visual story that anyone can understand. It's not
                    just
                    about creating pretty charts; it's about making complex information more accessible and meaningful.
                    Imagine you have a ton of numbers and stats data visualization transforms them into graphs, charts,
                    and
                    dashboards.</p>

                <p>Now, why is it crucial for business decision-making? Well, humans are visual creatures. We process
                    visual
                    information much faster than text or numbers. When you're dealing with heaps of data, a
                    well-designed
                    visualization can reveal patterns, trends, and insights that might be hard to spot in a spreadsheet.
                    It's like putting the pieces of a puzzle together in a way that makes sense.</p>

                <p>For businesses, this is gold. Decision-makers can quickly grasp the big picture, identify areas that
                    need
                    attention, and make informed decisions. It's like having a roadmap instead of wandering blindly
                    through
                    a data jungle. So, data visualization isn't just eye candy; it's a powerful tool for smarter, more
                    efficient decision-making.</p>

                <p>Let's talk benefits. First off, accessibility. Visuals are a universal language. Whether you're
                    a data scientist or someone allergic to numbers, charts bridge the gap and make information
                    accessible to everyone. Efficiency is another perk. Instead of wading through spreadsheets, a
                    well-crafted visualization can convey the message at a glance.</p>

                <p>Data visualization isn't just about making pretty pictures. It's about transforming data into a
                    language that speaks to everyone, empowering businesses to make smarter decisions. So, next time you
                    see a pie chart, remember, it's not just a slice of data; it's a slice of clarity in the chaos of
                    information.</p>

                <h4><u>Example</u></h4>
                <p><b>Pie Charts for Market Share</b></p>
                <p>If you're interested in understanding the market share of your company or products, a pie chart is
                    handy.
                    Each slice represents a different segment or product, making it easy to see the proportion of the
                    market
                    each segment.</p>


                <p>There are plenty of user-friendly tools out there that make data visualization a breeze, even for
                    those
                    without a hardcore tech background. There are few, such as Microsoft Excel or Google sheets.</p>

                <h4>Overview:</h4>
                <p>AI is like a business wizard; it is a magical assistant that helps one to see the future as well as
                    automate boring tasks. Just like a wizard’s spell book, AI analyses a whole lot of information very
                    quickly and provides insights to make smart decisions. When it comes to customers, AI is like a
                    friendly
                    sidekick that understands the customer's questions and provides them with personalized answers,
                    making
                    things easier, faster, and more exciting. </p>

                <h4>Neural networks</h4>
                <p>Working to simulate the mechanisms in our biological brain’s neurons. They originated from the
                    McCulloch and pits in 1943. Creating the first model of a basic neural network and showing its usage
                    in logical relations like AND or OR relations. From there they realized that it was possible for
                    their neural network could simulate the pattern recognition process used by the brain to identify
                    and classify patterns. Skip to 6 years later in 1949 where Donald Hebb proposed a learning scheme to
                    update the connections of the neurons. This was known as the Hebbian learning rule. This was built
                    and tested by Minsky leading to Frank Rosenblatt developing the first network architecture named
                    perceptrons. </p>
                <h4>Practical use</h4>
                <p>Neural networks can tell the difference between common and abstract patterns leading to it being
                    useful in many fields such as identifying fraudulent purchases. Neural networks detect patterns and
                    make comparisons with the general pattern used by the card holder. If an unusual pattern is
                    detected, then that transaction has a high chance of being fraudulent. This can also apply to many
                    other situations such as data analysis and the improvements made from the analysis or improvements
                    that can be made to a business based on the growth patterns and sales pattens that can be analyzed
                    by Neural Networks.</p>

                <p>AI in business involves using advanced algorithms to analyze data, automate processes, and make
                    predictions. It plays an important role in enhancing efficiency and decision-making within
                    information
                    systems</p>
